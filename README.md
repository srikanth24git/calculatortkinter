# GUI Calculator Application (Tkinter)

## 📌 Mini Project – Python GUI Calculator

This project is a **simple GUI-based Calculator** developed using **Python Tkinter**.  
It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations through an interactive desktop interface.

## 🧠 What is Tkinter?

Tkinter is Python’s **built-in GUI (Graphical User Interface) library** used to create desktop applications.  
It provides widgets such as:
- Window
- Button
- Entry
- Label  

Tkinter follows an **event-driven programming model**, meaning actions occur when a user interacts with the interface (clicks a button, types input, etc.).

## 🎯 Purpose of This Application

The main objectives of this calculator are:
- Create a graphical calculator using Python
- Allow users to:
  - Enter numbers and operators
  - Perform arithmetic calculations
  - Clear the input
  - Delete characters using backspace
- Evaluate mathematical expressions using Python’s `eval()` function
- Handle invalid expressions safely without crashing the application

## ✨ Features

- User-friendly graphical interface
- Supports basic arithmetic operations: `+  -  *  /`
- Clear (`C`) button to reset input
- Backspace (`<-`) button to delete one character at a time
- Error handling for invalid expressions
- Clean and modern UI design
